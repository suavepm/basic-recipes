    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The traditional Moroccan treatment for these tiny legumes is to stew them until tender in a flavorful sauce with tomatoes, onions, garlic and hearty quantities of Moroccan spices and herbs. We do notch up the seasoning a bit as we like lentils extra zesty and saucy, but for palates that don't lean toward a preference for piquant, the seasoning below will suffice.</p>

    <p>Moroccan stewed lentils can be served as a side dish or entr√©e. Many families make them weekly or regularly offer them alongside fried fish. This recipe is the vegetarian version, but meat may certainly be added.</p>
